# DSC-540: Homework #4
For this homework, I focused on the same dataset used in homework [#1](https://github.com/elssieg/DSC-540-Advanced-ML/tree/master/HW1), [#2](https://github.com/elssieg/DSC-540-Advanced-ML/tree/master/HW1), and [#3](https://github.com/elssieg/DSC-540-Advanced-ML/tree/master/HW1) along with a few COVID-19 datasets. The main focus of this study was:

* Bayesian Logistic Regression
* Bayesian Change Point Models 
* Bayesian Network

For the Bayesian Logistic Regression, I used the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The results showed that previous algorithms proved to be more performant, and accurate. For the Bayesian Change Point Model, I looked into how COVID-19 affected crime in Chicago. The results from the model indicated the exact time when a change in crime occurred in Chicago due to COVID-19. Last, but certainly not least, I created a COVID-19 health outcome prediction system using Bayes Network using random assumptions.
