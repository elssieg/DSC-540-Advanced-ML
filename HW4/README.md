# Homework # 4
The main focus of this homework is to apply the Bayesian Logistic Regression, as well as Bayesian Change point model in different datasets, and construct a Bayesian Network. 

For this homework, similarly to the previous 3 homeworks I focus also on the Winsconsin Breast Cancer Dataset and apply Bayesian Logistic Regression.

For the Bayesian Change point model, I looked into how COVID-19 has affected the crime in Chicago. The Bayesian Change Point Model will indicate us the exact time where there was this specific change in crime due to COVID-19.

And last, but not least I created a COVID-19 health outcome prediction system using Bayes Network. For this model, I construct this based on random assumptions.
