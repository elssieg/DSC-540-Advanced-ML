# DSC-540: Homework #2

For this homework, we are still working on the Winsconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. However for this one we are doing: Bootstrap, training a Random Forest Classifier, training a Gradient Boosting Classifier, and using GridSearch to find the best parameters for that specific algorithm.

Finally, we performed a stacked architecture for the breast cancer prediction problem.

Similarly to Homework 1, we compared the different algorithms by comparing their: 
i. Accuracy Score
ii. Confusion Matrix
iii. ROC Curve
iv. Precision Recall curves
