# DSC-540: Homework #2

For this homework, I continued working with the Winsconsin Breast Cancer dataset. However on this homework, we focused on different algorithms using _GridSearch_ to find the best parameters for each one. Those algorithms being:

* Bootstrap
* Training a Random Forest Classifier
* Training a Gradient Boosting Classifier

After the dataset completed its passthrough with each algorithm, I performed a _stack classification_ to see if I had an improvement in my model's accuracy score.

In addition to the study, I also compared the performance of the different algorithms using metrics, such as:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve
* Precision Recall Curve.
