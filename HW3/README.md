# Homework # 3
For the first part of this homework I focus on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (similar to Homework # 1 & 2).
I applied a Support Vector Classifier, and perform gridsearch to look for the best parameters. 

In the second half of the homework I looked into a COVID-19 Dataset and visualize the distribution using KDE of the map city.

I also applied Kernel Regression Model on the time series data to predict COVID-19 cases in Panama City, Panama. We use Support Vector Regression, and Kernel Ridge Regression.
