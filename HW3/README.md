# DSC-540: Homework #3
Continuing with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, from homeworks [#1](https://github.com/elssieg/DSC-540-Advanced-ML/tree/master/HW1) and [#2](https://github.com/elssieg/DSC-540-Advanced-ML/tree/master/HW2), I focused on one last algorithm known as _Support Vector Classifier_. I performed this algorithm, because it is well known for having high accuracy rates with smaller datasets, which is the case for the one I had been using. It was run alone for this reason.

In the other half of the homework, I focused on a COVID-19 dataset. Using KDE, I created a visualization of the distribution over a map of Panama City, Panama. In addition to this, I applied a Kernel Regression Model on the time series data to predict COVID-19 cases in the city.
