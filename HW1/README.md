In this homework I mainly focus on analyzing the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Patitients, and trying to predict the diagnosis of the cancer (M = malignant, B=benign) using dimensionality reduction, logistic regression, and decision trees. For the data, I splitted it into training (80%) and testing (20%).

We also compared the performance of the different algorithms using metrics such as : Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and Precision Recall Curve.
