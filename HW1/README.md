For this homework, I focused on analyzing a dataset of Wisconsin Breast Cancer patients to predict the diagnosis of cancer (M = malignant, B = benign). Splitting the data into training (80%) and testing (20%), I then processed the dataset using the following algothrims: 

* Dimensionality Reduction
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees

In addition to the study, I also compared the performance of the different algorithms using metrics, such as:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve
* Precision Recall Curve.
