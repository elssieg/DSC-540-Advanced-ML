In DSC-540, we learned different advanced modeling techniques, such as ensemble learning, extended linear models, probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian inferences, and kernel methods. Using a plethora of datasets spanning Wisconsin cancer patients to COVID-19 outbreaks we tested each of the algorithms above to see how they worked, and how confidant we were in the scores they produced. Additionally, we used the data to create visualizations, and accurately predict outcomes pertaining to the problem at hand.
